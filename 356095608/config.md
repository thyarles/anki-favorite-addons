#### when problems occur
If you have problems with this add-on: <br/>
1. Read [this Anki FAQ](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/when-problems-occur.html)<br/>
2. Disable all other add-ons, then restart Anki and then try again. If this solves your problem you 
have an add-on conflict and must decide which add-on is more important for you. <br/>
3. If you still have problems, reset the config of this add-on and restart Anki and try again.<br/>
4. If it still doesn't work you report the problem at 
https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/editor-batch-multi-replace-official-thread/6778 and describe
the exact steps needed to reproduce the problem.

Anki changes with each update (it gets better) and sometimes this breaks add-ons or changes how they work. So 
if an add-on no longer works as expected after an add-on: Make sure to have the latest version by manually 
checking for add-on updates. Then also have a look at the add-on listing on ankiweb, e.g. 
https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/356095608 for this add-on. On these pages add-on creators often 
list changes for their add-ons.
